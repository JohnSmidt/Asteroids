# Asteroids
Code for an asteroids game in OpenGL. Was created for a school project. Additional code implemented allows one to progress through different levels increasing in difficulty. Also, a bomb was added which "breaks" all rocks on the screen (or destroys them if they are small enough). Bomb can only be used once.
